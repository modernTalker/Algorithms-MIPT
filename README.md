# Algorithms-MIPT
In this repository there are basic-version implementations of some of the most important algorithms devided in five parts:
* Basic-Algorithms (such as sortings and standart data structures)
* Geometry (all instruments to work with Euclidian geometry in 2D)
* Graphs (important graph algorithms from finding the shortest paths to maximum flow solutions)
* RMQ-RSQ (this part dives into ways of different RMQ-RSQ tasks solving)
* String Algorithms (the most common formulations of the texts' and strings' problems and their solutions)
