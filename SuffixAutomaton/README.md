# Suffix Automaton Construction

The code demonstrates the implementation of a suffix automaton, a data structure used to manage a string and support various substring operations. 

* #### Node Structure

  The Node structure represents a node within the suffix automaton, comprising information about transitions, suffix links, lengths, and end positions.

* #### SuffixAutomaton Class

  The SuffixAutomaton class is responsible for constructing the suffix automaton and facilitating various operations associated with it.

* #### Constructors
  The overloaded constructor initializes the suffix automaton and populates it based on the provided string, achieving the construction of the suffix automaton.

* #### AddSymbol Function
  The AddSymbol function extends the suffix automaton by incorporating a new symbol into the structure, updating the transitions and suffix links accordingly.

* #### Traversal Function
  The Traversal function allows for a walk through the constructed suffix automaton, providing insight into its size, transitions, and structure.

This implementation leverages the construction of a suffix automaton, enabling management and manipulation of a given string to support various substring operations.
