# BFS Shortest Path

The provided code demonstrates solving a shortest path problem in a graph using breadth-first search (BFS). It represents a graph and provides functionalities to add edges, find the shortest path between two given vertices, and display the path from the source to the destination.

* #### Graph Class
  The Graph class defines an undirected graph and forms the base for the shortest path problem. It includes operations to add edges, display vertices, find the shortest path, and manage vertex neighbors.

* #### AddEdge Function
  The AddEdge function efficiently adds an edge between two vertices in the graph.

* #### PrintNeighbours Function
  The PrintNeighbours function lists the neighbors of a given vertex.

* #### ShortestPath Function
  The ShortestPath function uses breadth-first search (BFS) to compute the shortest path from a source vertex to a destination vertex in the graph.

* #### Main Function
  The main function acts as a user interface, receiving input for the number of vertices, edges in the graph, and source and destination vertices. It computes and displays the length of the shortest path and the actual path from the source to the destination.

This program clearly demonstrates the use of breadth-first search to identify the shortest path in a graph, providing an efficient way to navigate and analyze the connectivity of the vertices.
