# Manacher's Algorithm

The code showcases the implementation of Manacher's Algorithm, a powerful technique for finding the longest even palindromic substrings within a given sequence.

* #### Manacher Function
  
  The Manacher's algorithm serves to identify the longest palindromic substring centered at each position in a given string or array.

* #### Main Function

The main function serves as the program's entry point. It accepts user input, initializes the input sequence, and then calls the Manacher function to detect the palindromes.
