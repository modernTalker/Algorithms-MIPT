# Aho-Corasick Algorithm

The code demonstrates the implementation of the Aho-Corasick algorithm, which enables pattern matching for multiple patterns within a given input string.

* #### Trie Class

  The Trie class embodies the Aho-Corasick Trie data structure and is responsible for setting up the initial Trie, inserting patterns, building suffix and exit links, performing pattern searches, and collecting and printing occurrences of detected patterns within the input string.

* #### Constructor
  - The constructors initialize the Trie data structure, populate it with the provided patterns, and maintain critical information about string indices and potential matches.

* #### BuildSuffixLinks and BuildExitLinks
  - The BuildSuffixLinks and BuildExitLinks methods endow the Trie with suffix and exit links, crucial for efficient pattern matching when searching within the input string.

* #### Insert and Find
  - The Insert method facilitates the addition of individual patterns into the Trie, updating the Trie structure accordingly.
  - The Find method allows for searching specific patterns within the Trie and indicating their presence.

* #### CollectEntries and PrintEntries
  - The CollectEntries method gathers all occurrences of patterns detected within the input string.
  - The PrintEntries method outputs the found occurrences for each pattern in the given input string.

* #### AhoCorasick Function

  The AhoCorasick function serves as the entry point for setting up the Trie, populating it with the provided patterns, and establishing the necessary suffix and exit links to prepare for pattern matching within a given input string.

This implementation proficiently leverages the Aho-Corasick algorithm to match multiple patterns within a single input string, utilizing a Trie structure for streamlined pattern matching and detection.
