# Dijkstra's Algorithm

The following implementation features Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph. The code comprises a Graph class and a main function to handle input, construct the graph, and determine the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm.

* #### Graph Class
  The Graph class allows for the creation and manipulation of a weighted graph. It provides methods to resize the graph's size, add weighted edges, and perform Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the shortest path between specified vertices.

* #### Resize Function
  The Resize function enables the resizing of the graph.

* #### SpecialAdd Function
  The SpecialAdd function appends weighted edges to the graph.

* #### Dijkstra Function
  The Dijkstra function executes Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between given vertices.

* #### Main Function
  The main function acts as the user interface, receiving input for the graph's size, start and end vertices, and building the graph accordingly. It calculates and outputs the length of the shortest path between the specified vertices.

The code applies Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the shortest path in a weighted graph, providing a practical solution for pathfinding in graph structures.
