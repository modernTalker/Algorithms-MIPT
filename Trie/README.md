# Trie
The code establishes a basic Trie data structure allowing for insertion and search operations. It employs the Node and Trie classes to handle insertion and searching within the constructed Trie.

* #### Node Structure

The Node structure is designed to represent the individual nodes within the Trie, containing information about transitions and whether a node marks the end of a valid word.

* #### Trie Class

The Trie class encapsulates the core functionality of the Trie, providing features for insertion and searching of strings within the constructed tree.

* #### Insert Function
  The Insert function allows for the efficient insertion of a string into the Trie, populating the tree structure up to the respective letters of the word and marking the final node as a terminal node.

* #### Find Function
  The Find function permits the quick determination of whether a given string exists within the constructed Trie, returning a boolean value to indicate presence or absence.

* #### Main Function

The main function serves as the entry point, accepting user input to either insert or search for specific strings within the constructed Trie.

This implementation provides a basic Trie data structure, facilitating the insertion and searching of strings within the constructed tree to determine whether they are present or absent.
